# DSA-Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms Journey**!  

This repository documents my learning path, experiments, and problem solving.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand **when and why** to use each Data Structure  
- Explore **common use cases**  
- Solve problems of **gradually increasing difficulty**  
- Cover **most algorithms** on various Data Structures

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 00-Foundations
- Core concepts and differences between **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**

### 01-Arrays
- Basics, implementations, common problems, and complexity analysis

### 02-LinkedList
- Singly, doubly, circular lists, and problem solving

### 03-Stack
- Concepts, applications, and practice problems

### 04-Queue
- Simple queue, circular queue, priority queue, and challenges

### 05-Trees
- Binary trees, BST, AVL, and tree-based algorithms

### 06-Graphs
- Graph representations, BFS, DFS, shortest path, and advanced problems

### 07-Algorithms
- Searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming, and more

### 08-Problem-Solving
- Hard problems combining multiple Data Structures & Algorithms

## 🛠 How I Work

1. Study the concept  
2. Understand the **mathematical insight**  
3. Implement it in code  
4. Solve problems progressively  
5. Analyze **Time & Space Complexity**  
6. Document and share learning here

## 💡 Notes

- This repo is **my personal logbook** for learning, not just solutions  
- Focus on understanding **why things work**, not only coding
